# Portfolio Website

This project was built for learning and demonstration purposes.

## You are wellcome to clone the project and/or comment on it :) 

## Main Concept
This is a slideshow based website,
It contains an about page, contact form, pdf reader page, about me page, projects page, a site nav menu and a menu with links to websites I am on.

--- The slides are controled with on click events with buttons, 
scroll wheel works in chrome browsers for now, There are some css absolute and overflow issues on Mozilla. I think it makes event listeners to not fire correctly.


* Css was done with styled components and animation with framer motion 
* Icons are imported from font-awesome
* For the form backed I used Firebase
