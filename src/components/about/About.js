            I am a tehnology enthusiast focusing on website development. People
            find me to be a self motivated team player with excellent
            communication skills. I enjoy learning new skills and I have a huge
            drive to spend time and face programming problems. At the moment I
            am looking for a developer position at an IT company. If you're it,
            please shoot me an email.
